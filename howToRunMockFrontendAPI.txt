CrisisCloud (Flask + NWS Weather API)

CrisisCloud is a Flask web application that serves an HTML/Leaflet frontend and pulls live weather and active alerts from the National Weather Service (weather.gov / api.weather.gov) based on the map’s current center (latitude and longitude).
This version of the application does not use a database. All weather data is retrieved directly from the National Weather Service API in real time.
Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher
- pip package manager

Installing Dependencies:
pip install flask requests python-dotenv
Project Structure
Make sure your files are organized like this:
CloudCrisis_Backend/
├── .env
├── crisisCloudBackend.py
└── templates/
└── crisisCloud.html

Setup Instructions
1. In the command prompt cd to the directory where you placed the crisisCloud_backend folder
2. Run python crisisCloudBackend.py
3. Open a web browser and navigate to:
http://127.0.0.1:5000/

Environment Variables (.env file)
Create a file named .env in the same directory as crisisCloudBackend.py with the following content:
NWS_USER_AGENT=CrisisCloud/1.0 (your-email@school.edu)

This User-Agent is required by the National Weather Service.
Do not place the .env file inside the templates folder.

Testing the Weather API
You can test the live weather endpoint directly in your browser:
http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/weather/live?lat=36.9&lon=-76.3

Common Issues
TemplateNotFound Error:
Ensure crisisCloud.html is inside the templates folder and the Flask route references the correct filename.

Weather Not Loading:
Confirm the frontend is calling /api/weather/live and not an old endpoint.

.env Not Loading:
Ensure the file is named exactly .env and restart Flask after editing.

Notes for the Team
- This application uses live data from the National Weather Service.
- No database or caching layer is currently implemented.
- Shelter and food bank markers are demo data in the frontend.
